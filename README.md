## Risk Control Functions

The `SetRiskParameters` function is used to set specific risk parameters, including stop-loss and take-profit levels. This function takes two arguments: `stopLoss` (the desired stop-loss level) and `takeProfit` (the desired take-profit level). The code inside this function sets the stop-loss and take-profit levels accordingly.

The `ManageTrades` function is responsible for monitoring and managing trades based on the defined risk parameters. The code inside this function continuously checks the current market conditions and adjusts trades accordingly.

## Real-time Forex Analysis

The `RealTimeForexAnalysis` function provides real-time forex analysis using updated market data. This function utilizes the latest market information to generate insights and predictions about potential market movements.

## Technical Analysis Tools

The `IncorporateTechnicalAnalysis` function incorporates comprehensive technical analysis tools, such as charting capabilities and indicators. This function allows traders to analyze historical price data, identify patterns, and make informed trading decisions.

## Identify Entry and Exit Points

The `IdentifyEntryExitPoints` function enables traders to identify potential entry and exit points with precision based on the analysis. By considering various factors, including market trends, support and resistance levels, and technical indicators, this function helps traders determine optimal entry and exit points for their trades.

## Create Custom Forex Strategy

The `CreateCustomForexStrategy` function allows traders to create and customize their own forex strategies. This function provides flexibility and control over trading decisions by enabling traders to define their own rules and parameters for entering and exiting trades.

The `OnInit` function is called at the start of the program and sets the risk parameters, manages trades, performs real-time forex analysis, incorporates technical analysis, identifies entry and exit points, creates custom forex strategies, and integrates custom strategies into the Trex Pro MT4 platform.

The `OnTick` function is continuously called during the program execution and performs trading actions based on the analysis and strategies. Traders can implement their specific trading logic inside this function.

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is stopped or unloaded and performs cleanup actions, if necessary.
